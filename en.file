The Four Agreements Book Review
The Four Agreements:

Don’t try to guess what someone is thinking.
(Don't assume they already know what you want; if they don't, don't get angry—this person isn’t obligated to know what you want. You have to speak up for yourself.)

Don’t take anything personally, which is very important, for reasons I’m not entirely sure of.
(If you don’t take everything seriously/personal, you become an empty target for black magicians to cast a spell on you.)
[[And also, even if you do take something personally (if you just can’t stop taking things personally), try to think about this: imagine someone called you stupid. That person isn’t calling you stupid because of who you are; they’re calling you stupid because, in their Supreme Rulebook, you fit the category of what they consider “stupid.”]]

Be impeccable with your word.
(Since words are very powerful—like spells with functionality—the way you use your word is very important, because using the wrong words might cast a spell on someone unintentionally—or intentionally, and then it might come back to you.)

Always do your best.
(If you always give your best, you’ll never leave room for your Judge to decide whether you’re guilty or not. Moreover, by giving your best, you won’t overdo it by giving 100% nor underdo it by giving almost nothing—just stay in the 80–90% range.)
(And also, always giving your best shows how you do everything with happiness—have you ever seen a worker who gives everything for the sake of a paycheck? No. They just work for their wage, nothing more.)
(And the problem with not always giving your best is that you end up waiting for a reward at the end—even though there’s no reward along the way because you’re not enjoying it. But if you give your all, you stop expecting a reward—and you might even receive one that’s greater in the end.)

Judge == The great judge that decides if you’re guilty for every action you take.
(e.g., You study for 2 hours, work for 8, and use 3 for leisure. Your mini judge will say:
“Ahhh, damn, you’re not working because you’re a lazy bum??”
And you’ll feel guilty. However, if you give your all during those 8 hours of work, he won’t be able to judge you because you already did everything you could—there’s no way to work 13 hours.)
The Four Agreements serve exactly for this: to train the morals of your judge, so he understands your side too, and so that you don’t end up judging yourself millions of times a day.
And to access Heaven – Hell/Earth (but I’ll talk about that at the end :])

Spell == All the words and texts you use with other people.
Spells are “things/powers” that extend into White Magic and Black Magic.
(e.g. → WM: I tell you “Oh wow, how smart you are :)”, so logically you would think or say the same to me. But with BM, I tell you “Oh wow, how stupid you are,” so logically you might think/say the same about me and maybe even more. So not only you—but I, who used BM, also get screwed.)
WM (White Magic): You send good messages and speak good things, yet truthful (without lies), and use your word to improve not only your life but the lives of everyone around you.
BM (Black Magic): This is when you use your words or texts to hurt/cast a “curse” on someone—like when you say “oh wow, what an ugly person,” “oh wow, that person is so stupid.”
This kind of thing will not only hurt the person because if they are vulnerable or if their Supreme Rulebook considers what others say as truth, that person will truly believe they are stupid/ugly.
However, if you do that, that person—perhaps out of anger or other emotions—might cast another spell on you, saying that you are ugly/stupid, and then not only that person but you also get screwed.
That’s why there is “Be impeccable with your word.”

How to get to Heaven in Hell//Earth?
3 Needed Masteries (and one recap →)

0.5. You already have some basic knowledge or have been using the Four Agreements for a while (i.e., be impeccable with your word, always do your best, don’t take everything too seriously/not personally, and don’t try to guess what someone is thinking).

1. Another thing is to have the Awareness that you are in Hell, the Awareness of who you really are, and the Awareness of all the possible possibilities you have once you leave Hell on Earth.

2. The second thing is to know what you need to be Free from your *Domestication, and how you will change—what habits you need to adopt to accomplish what’s necessary.

3. The third Mastery is the mastery of Love: self-love and love for others, the love of knowing how to take care of yourself and your body, and knowing how to care for others (without using BM on anyone).

4 (made by me). Live in the Now and Today—don’t live in the past. Don’t keep dwelling on shameful or “wrong” things, as defined by you. Let those things go; they’re no longer necessary and never will be (unless it’s a crime, then maybe). You can think about the future, but the present is the most important—enjoy now, live your life happily (especially if you’re a kid), savor every second with your parents, and be happy. :)

Domestication == Domestication is the process by which, as a child, your parents and society domesticate you so that you are molded by the Beliefs that society and your parents give you. In doing so, you become just a mirror of what society (your country) accepts/rejects, and over time, you lose the Originality you had as a Baby.

How does it work?
After you have mastered the Four Agreements & the 3 Needed Masteries, you are already living in a completely different world—one where happiness exists and nothing or no one can worry you.
You do everything that your Nature dictates (just like a baby).
You will live a life where your mind is soil just for good seeds and where you also plant good seeds in other people.
Nothing anyone says to hurt you will work, and even if something hurts you mentally at some point, your mind and soul will not be affected—after all, your body is no longer soil for bad things (BM).
You will have healthy relationships because you’re not worried about trying to understand what your partner wants or if your partner understands what you want; you will always have a great understanding.

Thus, you have finally reached Heaven in Hell, and I hope it’s helping others follow this path free from judgment and pain.
Now your life is full of joy and happiness.

When I say "baby," I mean that babies are the only way to see how we would truly be if we were Free, because they act completely freely and their minds are solely their own, without the Supreme Rulebook, without your Judge, and with a personality that is uniquely theirs.

This site is made 100% with the purpose of learning and improving your life without having to read the book. I don’t want to steal any property from Don Miguel Ruiz, nor take his money, so please don’t sue me :] (seriously, please, I beg you.)
When I mentioned BM’s and WM’s, I’m not using any kind of racism; these are just terms found in the book—the names are his. If you want to know why Black and White are used as Bad and Good, ask the owner/writer of the book, not me. :)))

🌟 The Four Agreements – Review
The Four Agreements:

Don’t make assumptions
Don’t try to guess what the other person is thinking.
Don’t assume they already know what you want. If they don’t, it’s fine—they aren’t obligated to know.
You need to speak up for yourself.
Don’t get mad just because the person didn’t guess something that only exists in your head.

Don’t take anything personally
This is REALLY important, even if it doesn’t seem like it at first.
When you take things personally, you become a perfect target for black magicians to cast spells on you.
Even if it’s hard not to take things personally, try to remember this:
If someone calls you stupid, they aren’t calling you that because of who you are,
but because, in their own Supreme Rulebook, you fit the definition of a “stupid” person.
In other words: the problem isn’t you—it’s just what their social circle considers “stupid.”

Be impeccable with your word
Words are magical. Literally.
You can use words as spells—both to heal (white magic) and to hurt (black magic).
Saying “you’re stupid” can deeply hurt someone if they believe it, and it can reinforce a person’s negative self-image.
And when you use black magic on others, you attract it back to you.
Therefore, be impeccable with what you say.
Use words with intention.
Speak truthful things with respect.
Speak to help, not to hurt.

Always do your best
When you do your best, your inner Judge can’t criticize you.
You don’t keep feeling guilty because you know you gave everything you could at that moment.
Doing your best isn’t always giving 100% (that wears you out),
nor is it giving 10% (that’s neglect).
It’s about being in that 80–90% range, with balance, love, and focus.
And most importantly:
When you do your best, you stop waiting for rewards all the time.
You do it for the sake of doing—and happiness comes from that, and reward follows naturally.

🧠 Important Concepts
Judge = The inner judge
That voice that’s always judging you.
“Ahh, you didn’t work enough!”
“You should be studying right now…”
But if you did your best, there’s nothing for it to complain about.
The Four Agreements are a training to teach your Judge to be fair—and not to mess things up.

Spell == All the words and texts you use with other people.
Spells are “things/powers” that extend into White Magic and Black Magic.
(e.g. → WM: I say to you, “Oh wow, how smart you are :)”, so logically you’d think or say the same to me. But with BM, I say to you, “Oh wow, how stupid you are,” so logically you might think/say the same about me—and maybe even more. So it’s not only you; I, who used BM, also get screwed.)
WM (White Magic): You send good messages and speak good things, yet truthful (without lies), and you use your word to improve not only your life but the lives of everyone around you.
BM (Black Magic): This is when you use your words or texts to hurt/cast a “curse” on someone—like when you say “oh wow, what an ugly person,” “oh wow, that person is so stupid.”
This kind of thing will not only hurt the person, because if they’re vulnerable or if their Supreme Rulebook considers what others say as truth, they will truly believe they are stupid/ugly.
However, when you do that, that person—perhaps with anger or other emotions—might cast another spell on you saying that you are ugly/stupid; and then, not only that person but you also get screwed.

Why is the baby the perfect example (:])?
A baby lives with complete freedom.
They haven’t been domesticated yet.
They don’t have a Judge inside their head.
They don’t follow anyone’s Rulebook.
They’re 100% themselves—and that’s what we’re trying to get back to.

🌈 How to Reach Heaven in Hell/Earth
To leave Hell and live in Heaven (even while on Earth), you need to master three things:

0.5 — Already practicing the Four Agreements
This is the basics: living with more truth, presence, and love.

1. Awareness
You need to be aware that:

You’re living in Hell (mentally & physically)

Who you really are

What possibilities exist beyond pain

2. Freedom from Domestication
Understand how you were domesticated (by your parents, school, society)
And what needs to change for you to become who you really are.

3. Mastery of Love
Self-love. Love for others.
Taking care of your body, your mind, and your words.
Not using BM.
Loving without expecting anything in return.

4 (made by me).
Live in the Now and Today; don’t live in the past.
Don’t keep dwelling on shameful or “wrong” things according to you.
Leave those things behind—they’re no longer necessary and never will be (unless it’s a crime, then maybe).
You can think about the future, but the present is what matters most. Enjoy the now, live your life happily (especially if you're a kid), cherish every second with your parents, and be happy. :)

Domestication == Domestication is the process by which, as a child, your parents and domestic society shape you with the Beliefs they provide. Over time, you become merely a mirror of what society (your country) accepts/rejects, and eventually you lose the Originality you had as a Baby.

How does it work?
After you have mastered the Four Agreements & the 3 Needed Masteries, you will be living in an entirely different world—one where happiness prevails and nothing or no one can worry you.
You do everything your Nature dictates (just like a baby).
You will live a life where your mind is like soil that only nurtures good seeds, and where you also plant good seeds in others.
Nothing anyone says to hurt you will work, and even if something hurts you mentally at times, your mind and soul will not be affected—after all, your body is no longer soil for bad things (BM).
You will have healthy relationships because you won’t be overly concerned with trying to understand what your partner wants or whether your partner understands you; you will always have a great connection.

Thus, you have finally reached Heaven in Hell, and I hope it is helping others follow this path free of judgment and pain.
Now your life is full of joy and happiness.

When I say “baby,” I mean that babies are the only way to see how we’d truly be if we were Free, because they act completely freely and their minds are entirely their own—without the Supreme Rulebook, without your Judge, and with a personality that is uniquely theirs.
